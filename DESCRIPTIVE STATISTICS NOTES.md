# DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

#### In Descriptive statistics, we are describing our data with the help of various representative methods using charts, graphs, tables, excel files, etc.
#### In descriptive statistics, we describe our data in some manner and present it in a meaningful way so that it can be easily understood.
#### Most of the time it is performed on small data sets and this analysis helps us a lot to predict some future trends based on the current findings. Some measures that are used to describe a data set are measures of central tendency and measures of variability or dispersion.

### Types of Descriptive Statistics

### Measures of Central Tendency
#### It represents the whole set of data by a single value. It gives us the location of the central points. There are three main measures of central tendency:

##### -->Mean
##### -->Mode
##### -->Median

### What is Mean
#### It is the sum of observations divided by the total number of observations. It is also defined as average which is the sum divided by count.

### where, 

#### x = Observations
#### n = number of terms

#### What is Median?

##### Generally median represents the mid-value of the given set of data when arranged in a particular order.

##### Median: Given that the data collection is arranged in ascending or descending order, the following method is applied:

##### If number of values or observations in the given data is odd, then the median is given by [(n+1)/2]th observation.
##### If in the given data set, the number of values or observations is even, then the median is given by the average of (n/2)th  and  [(n/2) +1]th observation.
##### The median for grouped data can be calculated using the formula:

#### How to Calculate the Median?
##### To find the median, place all the numbers in ascending order and find the middle.

##### Example 1:

##### Find the Median of 14, 63 and 55

##### solution:

##### Put them in ascending order: 14, 55, 63

##### The middle number is 55, so the median is 55.

#### What is Mode
##### The most frequent number occurring in the data set is known as the mode.
Name	                    Anmol	Kushagra	Garima	Ashwini	Geetika	Shakshi
Marks Obtained (out of 100)	73	      80	       73	   70	   73	  65
##### The maximum frequency observation is 73 ( as three students scored 73 marks), so the mode of the given data collection is 73.

##### We can calculate the mode for grouped data using the below formula:
![mode-formula.png](attachment:mode-formula.png)

Where,

l = lower limit of the modal class

h = size of the class interval

f1 = frequency of the modal class

f0 = frequency of the class preceding the modal class

f2 = frequency of the class succeeding the modal class

## Dispersion and Measures of Dispersion

### What is Dispersion in Statistics?
#### * Dispersion is the state of getting dispersed or spread.
#### * Statistical dispersion means the extent to which numerical data is likely to vary about an average value. In other words, dispersion helps to understand the distribution of the data.

### Types of Measures of Dispersion
#### There are two main types of dispersion methods in statistics which are:

##### * Absolute Measure of Dispersion
##### * Relative Measure of Dispersion

![OIP%20%284%29.jpg](attachment:OIP%20%284%29.jpg)

### Absolute Measure of Dispersion:
##### * An absolute measure of dispersion contains the same unit as the original data set.
##### * The absolute dispersion method expresses the variations in terms of the average of deviations of observations like standard or means deviations. It includes range, standard deviation, quartile deviation, etc

![maxresdefault.jpg](attachment:maxresdefault.jpg)

####  *Range: It is simply the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value given in a data set. 
#### Example: 1, 3,5, 6, 7 => Range = 7 -1= 6
#### *Variance: Deduct the mean from each data in the set, square each of them and add each square and finally divide them by the total no of values in the data set to get the variance.
#### Variance (σ2) = ∑(X−μ)2/N
#### *Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance is known as the standard deviation i.e. S.D. = √σ.
#### *Quartiles and Quartile Deviation: The quartiles are values that divide a list of numbers into quarters. The quartile deviation is half of the distance between the third and the first quartile.
#### *Mean and Mean Deviation: The average of numbers is known as the mean and the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations of the observations from a measure of central tendency is known as the mean deviation (also called mean absolute deviation).

## Variance
#### Variance is the expected value of the squared variation of a random variable from its mean value, in probability and statistics. Informally, variance estimates how far a set of numbers (random) are spread out from their mean value.
#### The value of variance is equal to the square of standard deviation, which is another central tool.
#### Variance is symbolically represented by σ2, s2, or Var(X). 

#### The formula for variance is given by:
![latex_104ab167efe3f6e76039876d42dfde0e-5c5b1b7746e0fb00017dcf53.jpg](attachment:latex_104ab167efe3f6e76039876d42dfde0e-5c5b1b7746e0fb00017dcf53.jpg)
#### As we know already, the variance is the square of standard deviation, i.e.,

#### Variance = (Standard deviation)2= σ2

#### The corresponding formulas are hence,




 
 
 
 
 
Where X (or x) = Value of Observations

μ = Population mean of all Values

n = Number of observations in the sample set

 
N = Total number of values in the population

## How to Calculate Variance
#### Variance can be calculated easily by following the steps given below:

#### Find the mean of the given data set. Calculate the average of a given set of values
#### Now subtract the mean from each value and square them
#### Find the average of these squared values, that will result in variance
#### Say if x1, x2, x3, x4, …,xn are the given values.

#### Therefore, the mean of all these values is:

#### x̄ = (x1+x2+x3+…+xn)/n

#### Now subtract the mean value from each value of the given data set and square them.

#### (x1-x̄)2, (x2-x̄)2, (x3-x̄)2,…….,(xn-x̄)2

#### Find the average of the above values to get the variance.

#### Var (X) = [(x1-x̄)2+ (x2-x̄)2+ (x3-x̄)2+…….+(xn-x̄)2]/n

#### Hence, the variance is calculated.

## Important Notes on Measures of Dispersion

#### *Measures of dispersion are used to determine the spread of data. They are measured about a central value.
#### *Measures of dispersion can be classified into two types, i.e., absolute and relative measures of dispersion.
#### *Absolute measures of deviation have the same units as the data and relative measures are unitless.
#### *Range, variance, standard deviation, quartile deviation and mean deviation are absolute measures of deviation
#### *Coefficients of dispersion are relative measures of deviation

## Quartiles

#### *Quartiles are the values that divide a list of numerical data into three quarters.
#### *The middle part of the three quarters measures the central point of distribution and shows the data which are near to the central point. 
#### *The lower part of the quarters indicates just half information set which comes under the median and the upper part shows the remaining half, which falls over the median.

#### *Quartiles divide the entire set into four equal parts. So, there are three quartiles, first, second and third represented by Q1, Q2 and Q3, respectively. Q2 is nothing but the median, since it indicates the position of the item in the list and thus, is a positional average. To find quartiles of a group of data, we have to arrange the data in ascending order.
#### *In the median, we can measure the distribution with the help of lesser and higher quartile. Apart from mean and median, there are other measures in statistics, which can divide the data into specific equal parts. A median divides a series into two equal parts. We can partition values of a data set mainly into three different ways:

#### Quartiles
#### Deciles
#### Percentiles

#### Suppose, Q3 is the upper quartile is the median of the upper half of the data set. Whereas, Q1 is the lower quartile and median of the lower half of the data set. Q2 is the median. Consider, we have n number of items in a data set. Then the quartiles are given by;

#### Q1 = [(n+1)/4]th item

#### Q2 = [(n+1)/2]th item

#### Q3 = [3(n+1)/4]th item

#### Hence, the formula for quartile can be given by;
![quartile-formula.png](attachment:quartile-formula.png)


## Quartiles in Statistics
#### Similar to the median which divides the data into half so that 50% of the estimation lies below the median and 50% lies above it, the quartile splits the data into quarters so that 25% of the estimation are less than the lower quartile, 50% of estimation are less than the mean, and 75% of estimation are less than the upper quartile. Usually, the data is ordered from smallest to largest:

#### First quartile: 25% from smallest to largest of numbers
#### Second quartile: between 25.1% and 50% (till median)
#### Third quartile: 51% to 75% (above the median)
#### Fourth quartile: 25% of largest numbers
### Quartile Deviation
#### . Quartile deviation is defined as half of the distance between the third and the first quartile. It is also called Semi Interquartile range. If Q1 is the first quartile and Q3 is the third quartile, then the formula for deviation is given by;
![Quartile-Deviation-Formula.jpg](attachment:Quartile-Deviation-Formula.jpg)

### Interquartile Range
#### The interquartile range (IQR) is the difference between the upper and lower quartile of a given data set and is also called a midspread.
#### It is a measure of statistical distribution, which is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. Also, it is a calculation of variation while dividing a data set into quartiles. If Q1 is the first quartile and Q3 is the third quartile, then the IQR formula is given by;
